TODO BEFORE 2025-09-22
- Define roles: Each team member's duty is clearly defined.
- Self evaluation: Describe how your team will evaluate its progress, including how to determine if progress is too slow and how to recover if that happens.
	- RUBRIC: Self-evaluation is stated to occur at least every two weeks. The method of evaluation provides a clear indicator of team progress and can be used to correct course early and often if necessary.
- Minimum viable product (MVP): Define a minimum viable product for the Fall and Spring semesters. 
	- RUBRIC: Contract contains clear criteria for the minimum viable products to be produced in both Fall and Spring semesters.
